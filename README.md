Bot to ask for the hotline miami 2 release date with cat pictures, courtesy of [random cat](http://random.cat/)

Currently deployed on heroku using scheduler to tweet every day until we get the release date!

Feel free to adapt into your own regular tweet bot with cat pictures and contribute with more pictures.
Go to [the twitter apps page](https://apps.twitter.com/) to set up your own app and get API keys.

## Setup

You probably wanna use [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) to get your ruby version and bundle.
Then just have your terminal in the project's directory and execute `bundle` to grab your twitter gem and
use or schedule `ruby main.rb` to tweet for that damned release date.
