Bot to ask for the hotline miami 2 release date with cat pictures, courtesy of [random cat](http://random.cat/)

The bot was shut down a single day after it was deployed, since that's all I took to bully Dennaton into
[revealing the release date](https://twitter.com/HotlineMiami/status/562366157542277120).

Feel free to adapt into your own regular tweet bot with cat pictures and contribute with more pictures.
Go to [the twitter apps page](https://apps.twitter.com/) to set up your own app and get API keys.

## Setup

You probably wanna use [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) to get your ruby version and bundle.
Then just have your terminal in the project's directory and execute `bundle` to grab your twitter gem and
use or schedule `ruby main.rb` to tweet for that damned release date.
